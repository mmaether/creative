# Art Deco

This design was created for a class I took at St. John Fisher College. It was part of a web design course where we were working in conjunction with the journalism
department. We were tasked to create a splash screen where it would then direct user to categories of articles that journalism majors wrote.

For this design I took a picture of one of the more prominent buildings on campus, traced an outline of it, then set it to college colors. Then I found some art deco font type to add to the page. We also sliced the image in the PSD file and exported it so the different layers could be selectable.

From a web usability standpoint I don't think it's very efficient in its use of space. Having a design so vertical which forces people to scroll to see the whole design, such as in this respect, isn't efficient. Also some work arounds were done to make this work on all browsers, which was more difficult back then. We couldn't load up nicer fonts via Google Fonts or something similar, so an image needed to be done. There is also a lot of mobile usability issues that I would completely change. I would approach this much differently today due to the technology now available.

Having said that, this was one of my early web design projects, and overall I'm pretty happy with the visual aesthetics of it. It's a good reflection of a simple design that can be done easily and look relatively good.
