# Digital Painting

I have been taking [The Digital Painting MEGA Course: Beginner to Advanced](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-digital-painting-mega-course-beginner-to-advanced/) course by Austin Batchelor to learn how to draw, illustrate, and paint digitally, as it's always been something I've been wanting to do. I'll be using this repository to house the projects completed to track progress and to stay organized.

1. Amphibian Creature

The first project is a simple painting exercise. The ink outline was provided, but all the coloring was done alongside instructions. This is a great first project to get immediate results that look great pretty easily.
